## Double Exposure by Hannah Newland.

The images I selected are film photos I took in Whiritoa, a beach in the Coromandel where my family has a bach. I knew I wanted to use my film photos in some way, and I'm glad I got to use pictures of a place that is important to me.

The mask for each photo highlights the ocean. I wanted to see if the AI would be able to recognise it both when it takes up a lot of the photo and when it's tucked away in the corner, which it actually did really successfully. Before I tried the ocean pictures I wasn't having a lot of success with the masking, but it actually never got it wrong when it was making masks of the ocean. 

I was inspired by double exposure film pictures (taking pictures on a roll of film thats already been used), and I initially wanted them to be overlayed on top of the entire original picture. I then experimented a little bit with the bokeh blur effect, which I really liked the look of. I changed my mind and decided to just have a second image inside the mask of the first one, instead of covering the entire image i.e. another picture inside of the ocean of the first image. I used the texture grain example code as a starting point. 

I worked out how to do what I wanted with the texture grain code really quickly, but I felt it wasn't different from the original image enough yet. I then went to add the bokeh blur, which took a really long time (and many attempts) to combine that code with the example texture code, especially because the images took 5+ minutes to render with each attempt, which I found really frustrating.

Eventually, I got it to work! I thought the blur around the ocean made the mask seem clearer and more in focus, which was ultimately what I wanted because I didn't want the mask to get lost in the original image. The image I used in the masks was another picture of Whiritoa I took. 

The main page is laid out as follows:

The top 4 images are the inputs that I handmade masks for, as indicated by the 'Handmade' heading. The 4 below that are the outputs.
The 3rd row down are the inputs the AI made masks for, as indicated by the 'AI' heading. The 4 below that are the outputs.
